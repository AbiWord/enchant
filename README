libenchant -- Generic spell checking library
Maintainer: Reuben Thomas
Home page: https://abiword.github.io/enchant/

libenchant is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL (see the file
COPYING.LIB), with a special exception allowing the use of proprietary
spell-checking systems.

Enchant aims to provide a simple but comprehensive abstraction for dealing
with different spell checking libraries in a consistent way. A client, such
as a text editor or word processor, need not know anything about a specific
spell-checker, and since all back-ends are plugins, new spell-checkers can
be added without needing any change to the program using Enchant.

Enchant can be configured by the user, who can even add spell-checker
plugins if desired.

Enchant works with the following spell-checkers:

    * Hunspell (formerly Myspell)
    * Nuspell
    * GNU Aspell
    * Hspell
    * Voikko
    * Apple Spell (macOS only)
    * Zemberek

Enchant is written in C and C++, and its only external dependency is glib.

Enchant bindings are supplied for C and C++. API documentation is available
in the doxygen/html directory, or online (see the home page). There are
third-party bindings for various languages (see the home page).
