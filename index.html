<h3>What is Enchant?</h3>

<p>On the surface, Enchant appears to be a generic spell checking
library. You can request dictionaries from it, ask if a word is
correctly spelled, get corrections for a misspelled word, etc...</p>

<p>Beneath the surface, Enchant is a whole lot more - and less - than
that. You'll see that Enchant isn't really a spell checking library at
all.</p>

<p>"What's that?" you ask. Well, Enchant doesn't try to do any of the
work itself. It's lazy, and requires backends to do most of its dirty
work. Looking closer, you'll see the Enchant is more-or-less a fancy
wrapper around the <tt>dlopen()</tt> system call. Enchant steps in to
provide uniformity and conformity on top of these libraries, and
implement certain features that may be lacking in any individual
provider library. Everything should "just work" for any and every
definition of "just working."</p>

<h3>Enchant, Pipes, API, and ABI</h3>

<p>Enchant does not use pipes to talk with command line
programs. Enchant is a full-fledged library, with a C and C++ API. Its
communication with its various backends happens via "virtual function
calls", or at least the C equivalent thereof. The backends are small
C/C++ plugins. The backends themselves do not use the <tt>popen()</tt>
call, but instead link to various libraries (eg: <a
href="http://aspell.sf.net/">aspell</a>) and interface with said
library's API to "get the job done."</p>

<p>Further, enchant has a standard C API/ABI that will in due course
be frozen for all of eternity, barring any gross oversights or
shortcomings introduced by the author. I believe the current API to be
rather sufficient for my various projects' needs. It may not, however,
be sufficient for yours. If not, please read on to the "Enchant and
Collaboration" section below.</p>

<h3>No pipes? But I thought you support Ispell!</h3>

<p>Enchant does support most Ispell dictionaries. Back in the day, I
and some other folks from the AbiWord team forked Ispell in order to
turn it into a C library. Unfortunately, it had a lot of Ispell
"global state" cruft in it. Since then, we have turned this library
into a stateful C++ library, complete with 1st-class classes and
objects. In the process, we also believe that we've made Ispell more
flexible, and that there is room for further flexibility
still. Enchant's Ispell backend is based on this work done by myself
and others inside of AbiWord.</p>

<h3>Command Lines</h3>

<p>Enchant is <strong>not</strong> another "ispell compatible" command
line program. However, it does currently ship with one, as a
"technology demo." The program currently isn't particularly good,
especially when compared to 'aspell'. Contributions improving the
command line program are generously welcomed.</p>

<h3>Enchant and Wheels</h3>

<p>As far as I know, Enchant re-invents no wheels here. This wheel is
entirely new. Enchant doesn't implement its own correction code. It
doesn't "duplicate" functionality already found in other projects, as
frankly, it doesn't have much functionality of its own. Enchant wraps
a common set of functionality present in a variety of existing
products/libraries, and exposes a stable API/ABI for doing so. Where a
library doesn't implement some specific functionality, Enchant will
emulate it.</p>

<h3>Backends</h3>

<p>Enchant is capable of having multiple backends loaded at once. Currently, Enchant has 8 backends:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspell/Pspell (intends to replace Ispell)</li>
<li>Ispell (old as sin, could be interpreted as a defacto standard)</li>
<li>MySpell/Hunspell (an OOo project, also used by Mozilla)</li>
<li>Uspell (primarily Yiddish, Hebrew, and Eastern European languages - <a href="https://github.com/AbiWord/uspell">hosted on AbiWord github</a>)</li>
<li>Hspell (Hebrew)</li>
<li>Zemberek (Turkish)</li>
<li>Voikko (Finnish)</li>
<li>AppleSpell (Mac OSX)</li>
</ul>

<p>More/other backends are welcomed.</p>

<h3>Enchant and multiple backends</h3>

<p>Why would Enchant want to support multiple backends? There are
several reasons for this.</p>

<ul>

<li>Not all spell checking libraries are created equal. Their language
coverage and various algorithms aren't all of equal
quality. Spell-checking some languages is fundamentally different than
spell-checking others. For instance, one might want to write a word
processing document with both Yiddish and English words in it. If you
just have Aspell or Ispell installed, you can't currently spell-check
both languages. Enchant presents a consistent interface so that you
can have Uspell spell-checking the Yiddish bits and Aspell correcting
the English ones. Your Word Processor needn't know the fact that 2
different spell-checkers are needed for this task. It all "just works"
(tm). Also consider the fact that (perhaps) Aspell does a better job
at handling English than Ispell, but Ispell does a better job at
French. You as a user don't want to use a sub-standard spell
checker. Enchant provides a few different solutions to this problem 1)
Define an ordering of providers based on language tags 2) Install an
English Aspell dictionary and a French Ispell one. Don't install a
French Aspell one or an English Ispell one. Either way, the intended
result will happen like magic, because Enchant allows you to have 0 or
more backends active at the same time.</li>

<li>We want to provide a consistent API to all of these
backends. Fundamentally, they all do a similar job and expose similar
functionality to the outside world. But they don't present a
consistent API, and many don't or won't have a stable API and/or
ABI. Some of them didn't even have an API/ABI until Enchant came along
&lt;cough&gt;Ispell&lt;/cough&gt;. This is a problem for consumer
programs, such as Office applications. Enchant will shield you from
these problems via its plugin architecture, and stable API/ABI.</li>

<li>We want to integrate well with native solutions. This means that
we want to have a "MacOS X" backend that uses the builtin
spell-checker. We want a "MS Office" backend that uses their
plugins. We want to be viral, invasive, seamless, and
all-encompassing. And we want to do it well.</li>

<li>We want to integrate with whatever solution the user already has
installed, be it Ispell, Pspell, MySpell, ... and not force some
alternative down their throats, or force them to install a different
dictionary to work with OpenOffice than they need to work inside of
GEdit.</li> </ul>


<h3>Enchant and API Inspiration</h3>

<p>Enchant's API was inspired by the Aspell/Pspell API, and aims to be
both a superset and a "ease of code" simplification of said API.</p>
<p>All inputs and outputs are in UTF-8 encoding. All language tags are
based on ISO standards, and take the form of "xx_YY"
(language_LOCALE), where the locale ("_YY") portion is optional, but
encouraged. We may consider extending the language tag mechanism to
accomodate future needs, such as medical dictionaries.</p>

<h3>Enchant and Multi-User systems</h3>

<p>Enchant strives to support multi-user systems as well as is humanly
possible. This in part means that users can have locally defined
plugin backends for enchant (for example, in <tt>~/.enchant/</tt>)
that work with the spell checker of their choice. This is in addition
to any globally installed plugin providers. The user-defined plugins
are guaranteed to always take precedence.</p>

<p>Similarly, several of Enchant's backends support user + global
dictionaries. This includes the Ispell, Uspell, and Myspell
backends. Users may have locally installed dictionaries (for example,
in <tt>~/.enchant/ispell</tt> or <tt>~/.enchant/uspell</tt>) in
addition to any globally installed ones. As with plugins, the
user-defined dictionaries will always take precedence over the
globally installed ones.</p>

<p> Also, both user-local and global Provider Ordering files can
coexist, with the values in the user-local one guaranteed
precedence. Further, an API exists so that one can modify said
orderings at runtime, if necessary.</p>

<p>Why is this done?</p>

<ul>
<li>User might not have a multi-user license to use a particular spell checker</li>
<li>User might not have a multi-user license for a particular dictionary</li>
<li>User might've modified a plugin or dictionary and not want/have administrator priveleges to update a global dictionary or plugin, or add a new plugin/dictionary</li>
<li>User might have a different idea of which spell checker provides the best result for various languages than the administrator does.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Building Enchant</h3>

<p>Enchant strives to be buildable with <strong>any</strong>
toolchain, not just the GNU ones. Currently, the only ones that have
been tested are the GNU one (or any toolchain capable of being driven
by auto* and libtool) and MSVC. This, however, does not mean that we
want to stop here. We want Enchant to build with the compiler and
linker of your choice. For example, the fact that I don't own a copy
of MSVC shouldn't stop you from sending me a DSW project file that is
capable of building Enchant. I will add it gratefully.</p>

<p>Enchant is vanilla C and C++ code, and as such should be buildable
with just about any C/C++ compiler known to man. Some of it is based
on AbiWord code, which compiles on [Unix, MacOS, BeOS, QNX,
Win32]. Some of it uses Glib2 code, which compiles on [Unix, MacOS,
Win32, BeOS, QNX, ...]. In short, enchant's code should be
<strong>highly</strong> portable. If something doesn't work for your
$COMPILER on $PLATFORM, please send problem reports or patches that
fix the problem. Other than that, the only "obstacle" should be
getting a build system set up for Enchant for your particular
$COMPILER and $PLATFORM, which shouldn't be too daunting of a
task.</p>

<p>Enchant exposes 0 outside dependencies, save LibC. Internally,
Enchant only requires Glib2 version 2.6 or later. This was done for
pragmatic reasons - it's simply easier to use a portability library
that handles modules, lists, etc... than writing one's own copy. That
said, patches to remove the Glib2 dependency are welcomed. As I said,
the decision to include it in the first place was extremely
pragmatic. I didn't want to put it in, but I didn't want to rewrite a
portability library, so I chose one I'm familiar with, is well tested,
and works well. It saved me time getting the project off the
ground. Now that it works and there is some outside interest, I'd
wouldn't be saddened to see it go, provided that a viable alternative
was implemented.</p>

<h3>Enchant and AbiWord [i.e. Collaboration]</h3>
<p>Enchant was written by AbiWord's maintainer and lead developer. He also develops and maintains a lot of other software too. Enchant was inspired by a host of bugs in the <a href="http://bugzilla.abisource.com/">AbiWord bugzilla</a>. Please don't let the "AbiWord" part throw you for a loop.</p>

<p>
The developer's intentions are for Enchant to be as widely adopted and successful as possible. 
He wants this to be used by (<a href="http://koffice.kde.org/">KOffice</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>, 
<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, ...). Patches and contributions from non-AbiWord developers are not only gladly welcomed, but strongly encouraged. Don't settle for mediocrity - stand up and be counted.
</p>

<p> As with many proposed standards, the initial work on Enchant was
done to address a real need in a real product by a real developer. It
was not designed by committee. It addresses the author's needs
remarkably well. Also like many standards, the author proposes his
current body of work for discussion, collaboration, improvement, and
ultimately standardization. It is often useful to have a working
reference base in order to stimulate and direct discussion. The
Enchant codebase is meant to do exactly that.  </p>

<p> For the record, Enchant is already in use by <a
href="http://www.abisource.com/">AbiWord</a>, while <a
href="http://www.lyx.org">Lyx</a> and <a
href="http://www.conglomerate.org/">Conglomerate</a> are presently
considering using it. Gnome-Spell and GtkSpell are currently in the
works of transitioning between Pspell and Enchant. We hope to achieve
broader use at an exponential level.  </p>

<p> The current list for Enchant discussion is the AbiWord-devel
list. Please see <a
href="http://www.abisource.com/developers/">http://www.abisource.com/developers/</a>
for more information on how to join, and for archives. If there is
sufficient interest, I can look into moving this onto a separate, more
"neutral" list, such as a <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/">Freedesktop.org</a> one.  </p>

<h2>Issues with Enchant</h2>
<hr />
<p>Obviously, there are going to be issues, bugs, patches, RFEs, etc... for Enchant. These are gladly welcomed. You may do one of a few things (in my order of preference):</p>

<ul>

<li>File your issue in <a
href="https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant/issues/new">Github issue
tracker</a></li>

<li>Send a message to the abiword-devel mailing list</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enchant's Future</h3>
<p>Some stuff that we're thinking about or are already in the process of adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardization!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enchant's License</h3>

<p>Enchant is currently licensed under the LGPL license, with an
Exception so that non-free (as in speech and/or cost) plugin backends
could be loaded and used by Enchant. This is mainly so that we can use
the native spell checkers on various platforms (MacOS X, MS Office,
...), or that our users could "plug in" their favorite commercial
product to do the job.</p>

<p>The author would consider re-licensing it as necessary to help
foster broader adoption. This may include MPL or JCA/SISSL license,
but the author would also consider alternate licenses as well.</p>

<h3>What's in a Name?</h3>

<p>"Enchant"'s English definition is roughly "to cast a spell" - whose
meaning seemed to fit in well with a spelling-oriented framework. Add
to that the fact that I wrote most of this this on a lonely Sunday
morning while my gf was engrossed with "Harry Potter and the Order of
the Phoenix", and you can see where I got its name ;-)</p>
