.SH ENCHANT ORDERING FILE
Enchant uses global and per-user ordering files named \fIenchant.ordering\fR
to decide which spelling provider to use for particular languages.
The per-user file takes precedence.
.PP
The ordering file takes the form language_tag:<comma-separated list of spelling
providers>. To see what providers are available, run \fIenchant-lsmod\fR. '*' is
used to mean "use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed otherwise." For example:
.PP
*:aspell,hunspell
.br
en:aspell,hunspell
.br
en_GB:hunspell,aspell
.br
fr:hunspell,aspell
.SH FILES AND DIRECTORIES
Enchant looks in two places for files, in the \fIenchant\fR subdirectory of
the system data directory (default: \fI$(datadir)\fR) and of the user
configuration directory (default: \fIENCHANT_CONFIG_DIR\fR, or, if that is
not set, \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME/enchant\fR on UNIX systems, which defaults to
\fI~/.config\fR, and the user's \fIAppData\fR directory on Windows).
The per-user directory takes precedence if it is found.
Dictionaries are looked for in a subdirectory with the same name as the
provider; for example, \fI/usr/share/enchant/hunspell\fR and
\fI~/.config/enchant/hunspell\fR. Some providers can be configured at
build time to look in a different system directory, which is useful when there is a
standard place to put dictionaries for that provider.
